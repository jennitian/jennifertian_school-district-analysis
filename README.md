# School District Analysis
module 4 challenge

## The Problem
Recent revelations have disqualified the test scores of 9th grade glass at Thomas High School. This finding changes our previous analysis of test scores across the 15 school districts. Below is a summation of some changes.

## Findings
- District Summary: The average math score has decreased from 79% to 78.9%, while the average reading score remains the same. The percentage of students passing math and reading across all districts drops by 1% for both subjects.
- School Summary: For Thomas High School, the average math score drops from 83.42 to 83.35. The average reading score, however is raised from 83.84 to 83.89. The most significant change is in the % passing students. It drops from greater than 90% passing to less than 70% lassing in both subjects. Overall percentage passing also drops.
- Ranking: In comparison to other schools, Thomas Highschool drops from the 2nd highest performing school in the district to the lowest performing school in the district. 
- By Grade: Thomas High School 9th grade is no longer comparable to 9th grade scores of other schools. Other grades' scores do not change.
- By School Spending: Despite having the 6th highest per student budget (2nd highest spending range per student in the district) Thomas High School is now the lowest performing school in the district.
- By School Size: Although smaller and medium sized schools typically perform well. Without the 9th graders scores, Thomas becomes the lowest performing medium sized school in the district.
- By School Type: The percentage of students passing math and reading in charter schools both drop by 4% while the % overall passing drops by 3%. 

## Conclusion
Without the 9th graders' scores from Thomas High School in consideration, all parameters involving Thomas High School drop, but general trends in data remain the same. Math scores have a lower percentage of passing than reading. Medium and small sized schools perform better (with Thomas High being the outlier). This may or may be a more accurate representation of all districts performances because the fraudulent scores cannot skew the data. However, without any values for 461 students in the district, it's difficult to know exactly how accurate our conclusions are.
